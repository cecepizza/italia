# Italian Property Research Assistant

Help me automate research for Italian properties in these towns:
- Crotone, Calabria
- Catania, Sicily  
- Andria, Puglia
- Rodi Garganico, Puglia

Please create a Python script that:

1. Scrapes property listings from major Italian real estate websites
2. Translates descriptions from Italian to English
3. Extracts key data (price, size, bedrooms, condition)
4. Calculates price per square meter
5. Identifies properties matching our criteria:
   - Under €150,000 (adjust to your budget)
   - 2+ bedrooms
   - Habitable or minor renovation needed
6. Generates a weekly HTML report with photos and links
7. Sends email digest to family members
8. Tracks price changes on saved properties

Include error handling and make it run on a schedule.
