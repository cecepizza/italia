# Italian Property Family Assistant Bot

Create a chatbot that family members can query:

- "What's the average price in Andria?"
- "How far is Crotone from the beach?"
- "Show me 3-bedroom houses under 100k"
- "What did the expat in Puglia say about internet?"
- "Compare property taxes in all our towns"
- "What's the weather like in Catania in March?"

The bot should:
1. Access our accumulated research data
2. Search for new information if needed
3. Keep track of who's asking what (to gauge interest)
4. Suggest properties based on individual preferences
5. Answer in multiple languages (English/Italian)
6. Work via SMS/WhatsApp/Discord
